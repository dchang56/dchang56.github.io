# Introduction

Key challenge: getting knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional, heterogeneous biomedical data.

growing availability of data; precision medicine; 

high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, temporal dependency, sparsity, irregularity [13-15]

ontologies and inconsistencies: SNOMED-CT, UMLS, ICD-9 [16-19]

requirement of domain expert/manual feature engineering: no scalability and very limited

Representation learnin: minimizes manual intervention and domain knowledge requirements, uses raw data [21,22]


DeepMind is diving into health care [28]
