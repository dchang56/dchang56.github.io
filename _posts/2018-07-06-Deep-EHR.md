# Introduction

Explosion in amount of EHR data enables application of DL to clinical tasks using EHR data.
i.e. information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, deidentification, trajectory modeling, disease inference, clinical decision support systems, etc

Limitations of current research: interpretability, data heterogeneity, lack of universal benchmarks

EHR data include: demographic, diagnoses, lab tests and results, prescriptions, radiological images, clinical notes, etc.
Useful for clinical informatics as well as operations

Most techniques for EHR data until recently were based on traditional ML and statistical techniques such as logistic regression, SVM, and random forests.

main: DL techniques employed for EHR data analysis and inference; concrete clinical applications enabled by them

unlike [24] which focuses on a broad scope, this reviewfocuses exclusively on DL for EHR

*Search strategy and selection criteria*

searched google scholar for studies published up to and including Aug 2017;
terms: EHR, EMR, deep learning, or technique names

**IDEA: could do more exhaustive cataloguing of recent publications and make pretty graphs**
