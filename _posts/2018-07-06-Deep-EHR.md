# Introduction

Explosion in amount of EHR data enables application of DL to clinical tasks using EHR data.
i.e. information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, deidentification, trajectory modeling, disease inference, clinical decision support systems, etc

Limitations of current research: interpretability, data heterogeneity, lack of universal benchmarks

EHR data include: demographic, diagnoses, lab tests and results, prescriptions, radiological images, clinical notes, etc.
Useful for clinical informatics as well as operations

Most techniques for EHR data until recently were based on traditional ML and statistical techniques such as logistic regression, SVM, and random forests.

main: DL techniques employed for EHR data analysis and inference; concrete clinical applications enabled by them

unlike [24] which focuses on a broad scope, this review focuses exclusively on DL for EHR

*Search strategy and selection criteria*

searched google scholar for studies published up to and including Aug 2017;
terms: EHR, EMR, deep learning, or technique names

**IDEA: could do more exhaustive cataloguing of recent publications and make pretty graphs**

*EHR*
here they narrow the scope to EHR data types (exclude images and genomic)


# Deep EHR Learning Applications

*Summarized in Table III*

**Public databases**
MIMIC, clinical note datasets from i2b2

## A. EHR information extraction
concept extraction: Jagannatha [15,16] treat it as a sequence labeling task (LSTM, GRU, biLSTM
-all variants of RNNs outperformed CRF baselines
temporal event extraction: assigning notions of time to each extracted EHR concept
relation extraction: relationships between medical concepts in free text
abbreviation expansion: 197k+ unique medical abbreviations found in clinical text [37]; word embedding approaches

Use precision, recall, F1 score for classification metrics

## B. EHR representation learning
currently: use handcrafted schema to map structured medical concepts (each code is mapped to a code by ontology)
DL method: learn embeddings of medical codes as real-valued vectors; unsupervied; 
furthuer, can learn patient representation (if you view patients as collections of codes, medical events)
Usually, patient representation are used to optimize other supervised learning tasks by learn better representations of the input

**concept representation**
"EHR concept vectors" capture latent similarities and natural clusters between medical concepts. objective: derive vector representations from sparse medical codes such that similar concepts are nearby in lower-dimensional vector space
*Distributed embedding*: an encounter can be seen as a sequence of discrete medical codes with time stamps (like a sentence with ordered list of words). Can use skip-gram in the context of clinical codes to derive distributed code embeddings; relies on sequential ordering of medical codes
*Latent encoding*: restricted RBM, AEs

**Patient representation**
Choi derives distributed vector representations of patient sentences (ordered sequences of ICD-9, CPT, LOINC, NDC, using both skip-gram and RNNs)
Miotto: generate patient vectors from raw clinical codes via stacked AEs

*method of evaluation for EHR representation learning*
often evaluate representations based on auxiliary classification tasks (assumption: improvements are attributed to a more robust representation)

**Outcome prediction**
-statis outcome prediction
-temporal outcome prediction

**Computational phenotyping**
traditionally, diseases are defined by clinical descriptions, qualitative.
computational phenotyping aims for data-driven characterizations of illnesses (i.e. by clustering clinical descriptors)
Hope to get a more fine-grained description of disease; important for personalized/precision healthcare)
Two primary applications:
1. discovering/stratifying new subtypes (unsupervised)
2. discovering specific phenotypes for improving classification under existing disease boundaries and definitions (supervised)
