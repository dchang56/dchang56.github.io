Hello! I'm just about to begin my third year of PhD at Yale, and I'll be delving into a topic that has interested me for a while: Deep Learning for Electronic Health Records. 

I have a lot of catching up to do, and I figured putting together a literature review would be a good way to get a sense of what's been happening in the field, who the main players have been, and what problems I would like to tackle during my PhD. Fortunately, it's a relatively new and fast growing field, and doing a literature review seems manageable and rewarding (though still challenging). My hope is that by the end of this endeaver, I'll be in a position to start contributing actively to the community.
